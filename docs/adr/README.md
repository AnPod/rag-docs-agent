# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** documenting key technical decisions for the RAG Documentation Agent project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help future developers (and future you) understand why the codebase looks the way it does.
